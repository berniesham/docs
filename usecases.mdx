ESP can be used in a number of ways to enable reporting, optimisation and automation of environmental campaign data.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="General Reporting">
    - ESP can help to determine the total environmental emissions generated by a campaign, country, platform or brand for a specified period. Comparing this against a benchmark will help to contextualise how the activity has performed.
    - e.g. pulling data for a campaign to set as a baseline
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Comparison Reporting">
    - Comparing various campaigns, countries or brands can highlight differences in approach and perhaps the opportunity for best practices to be identified and highlighted, or for focus areas that need work.
    - e.g. comparing how the same campaign activated across several countries differed and understanding the reasons why some were more or less efficient (format focus, creative time etc)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Identifying most environmentally efficient performers">
    - Customers might want to compare the relative performance of social platforms, or within that, the performance by video length to understand where they should focus budget. For adtech partners, they may want to package their most environmentally efficient formats into an eco-package to have a lower carbon option in their product offering
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Identifying least environmentally efficient performers">

    - Converse to the previous point, customers will want to know which are the least efficient performers and ensure that they have other valuable reasons for keeping the format/partner, find a way to reduce the impact or reduce investment in them in favour of something more efficient
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Custom bidding (soon)">
    - Custom bidding enables additional dimensions to be included in bidding decisions. Speak to your account manager to discuss automating an export from EXPLORE to power your custom bidding in another platform
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Feeding into broader carbon reporting initiatives">
    - Our Explore section is a powerful custom report builder that enables customers to define and design the dimensions and metrics they want output from our system. This makes it extremely useful for feeding into broader carbon reporting initiatives as they can make the reports as granular or top-line as they wish and easily ingestible by their other systems or reporting requirements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Reduction and avoided emissions reporting">
    - Please review the REDUCE section of this documentation for more details
    - Compare a scope A with a scope B to determine the reduced or avoided emissions arising from some changes between them. This should either be done in very large aggregate (e.g. comparing year on year performance or brand vs. brand) with total emissions or on a emissions/electricity consumption per â‚¬1000 for smaller scopes (e.g. comparing campaign vs. campaign or changes to format selection, scheduling, targeting etc).
    - e.g. compare the effects of creative asset compression mid-way through a campaign to compare like for like activity with a single change isolated or q1 2024 vs q1 2023
