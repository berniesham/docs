title: 'Campaign Management'
description: 'Activity mapping and management'
---


This section was built to allow marketers to manage their connected platforms with their various line items and formats into meta-campaigns within ESP. 

<Note> Although we can automatically ingest data and structure from your platforms, we cannot map between different line items or platforms so this needs to be done manually. </Note>

An ***Activation*** is a *campaign* from a *platform*. We have named it this way to avoid confusion from the ***Campaign*** term within ESP. By collating ***Activations*** into ***Campaigns*** you can get a top-line view of your activity without having a complicated filter selection process every time you want to analyze a set of activity that sits across multiple *platforms*, *accounts* or *campaigns*.


## Activations:

This section lists all the activations for all platforms which were sent to IMPACT+ following the onboarding process.

From this page you will be able to manage your activations:
- Assign them to a campaign
- Update the creative weights per device
- Update the video duration
- Update the creative format used (ie. Facebook and Instagram)

## Campaigns:

The section lists all the campaigns which were created by you or your team and enables you
to:
- Create new campaigns
- View number of activations assigned to the campaign
