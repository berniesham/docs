## What’s New

### **Creative Weight Optimization Declaration**

Building on the success of our optimization declaration feature, we have added further capability to be able to declare creative weight optimizations.

This is important because creative weight is a significant contributor to overall GHG emissions and a major lever for reduction. Rather than using original file sizes which are not the true As creative weight isn't available in most of the platforms reporting APIsthat is used in platforms, we have built a model based on our hundreds of studies : where we have takenby taking the platform-compressed file weights of optimized and non-optimized creatives delivered to the user and broken it down by platform, by creative type, by format and by device, we to provide an accurate and a scalable model of reduction potential for optimized creatives.

With this feature, you will be able to easily identify where optimizations have been made and the resulting impact on your environmental performance!

For more information on how to use this and other optimization declaration features, please refer to the [online documentation](https://docs.weareimpactplus.com/campaignmanagement#optimization-declaration).

**SSO (Single Sign-On) Support**

We are happy to announce that we can now support Single Sign-On functionality with all major providers, including Microsoft ID Entra, Google, Okta and more.

To get started with an integration, please discuss your needs with your CSM, providing them details of your SSO provider and your internal administrator so that we can provide them the relevant details to activate SSO on your accounts.

## **What’s New:**

### **Optimization Declaration:**

We've introduced a new feature to further improve the accuracy of your campaign's environmental impact, particularly in regards to efforts you have made to reduce your campaigns’ carbon footprint. It allows you to declare specific optimizations that can’t be automatically captured through our API connections to your buying platforms, such as:

- Wifi-only targeting
- Cellular targeting exclusion
- Lower carbon budget scheduling
- Creative & format selection

For further details including how to activate this on your campaign, please refer to our [online documentation](https://docs.weareimpactplus.com/campaignmanagement) 

## **Major Enhancements:**

### Reporting

- **Improved Reporting performance:** We’ve significantly improved the performance of various reporting features by over 50%. As an added bonus, it even reduces our electricity consumption! This has reduced the load/run time of the following evaluations:
    - Overview / Performance dashboards
    - All Report exports
    - Reduced / Avoided emissions

- **Reduced/Avoided Emissions Report UI:**  A lot of processing goes into creating these analysis so they can take some time depending on your settings. For this reason, we have modified the reports to:
    - **Run asynchronously:** You can now navigate away from the page while your report is loading and return when it is done!
    - **Be cancellable in progress:** If you realise that you forgot to incorporate a filter or need to change the dates, you can now stop the report from processing immediately and correct it. No more wasted time or electricity on unneeded reports.
    - **Notify you via e-mail when it is complete:** You will now receive an e-mail to let you know your analysis is complete so you can navigate back to the reduction section on your own schedule.

### Emissions Model improvement

- **Improved creative weight model** : Creative weights are now computed with higher precision, down to the specific format and platform rather than creative type. This model applies to all new creatives, and will be applied progressively to past creatives in the next few weeks.
- **Creative duration:** Exact creative durations are now pulled from DV360 and Youtube, for all new creatives and will be applied progressively to past creatives in the next few weeks. ****Other platforms would be added in the future.

## Additional Enhancements

### Creative Optimizer

- **Notification Email:** We’ve made it easier to go through your CO notification e-mails by adding a summary of what you submitted and what was optimized in the e-mail body so you know exactly which zip file you’re downloading!
- **File Support:** We now support videos without audio for specific formats that don’t require it

### Supported Platforms

- **Google Ads:** We have added Google Ads to our supported list of platforms we can connect via API. This is specifically for Display/Video activity and complements the support we already have in place for DV360. It also means that Youtube is covered whichever platform you buy it from.

We're committed to continuously improving your IMPACT+ experience. We believe these updates will help manage your sustainability goals with greater efficiency.

As always, feel free to reach out to our support team if you have any questions.
